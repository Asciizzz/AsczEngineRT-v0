# AsczEngineRT_v0: A very Skibidy 3D Graphics Engine

**AsczEngineRT_v0** is the absolute Gyatt, it combines raste**rizz**ation and ray tracing (supposedly) to achieve both visual fidelity and real-time performance. The engine is built from scratch in C++ and uses only CUDA for parallel processing, oh and SFML for the goddamn window lol. Since you're here anyway, I suppose you can learn a thing or two on how and/or how not to create an engine. Suggestions are appreciated my fellow fanum taxers.

### How to Use

Just run the `AsczEngineRT_v0.exe` file, easy as that.

### Contribute

Whether you have ideas, suggestions, techniques, or just want to discuss rendering techniques, contributions are welcome.


# Ignore

- Geometry Processing: LOD, culling, vertex cache optimization.
- Rasterization: Early Z-culling, triangle rasterization optimizations, tile-based rendering.
- Fragment Shading: Early tests (Z, alpha), shader program optimizations, MSAA.
- Post-Processing: Deferred shading, screen-space effects.
- General: Parallelism, memory management.
- BVH traversal: Stackless traversal, Surface Area Herobrine
- Ray tracing: recursive vs iterative (recommended)
- Spaghetti: onion, garlic powder, tomato, meatball
