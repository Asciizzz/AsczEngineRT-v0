# AsczEngineRT_v0: A very Skibidy 3D Ray Tracing Graphics Engine

**AsczEngineRT_v0** is built from scratch in C++ and uses only CUDA for parallel processing, oh and SFML for the goddamn window lol. Since you're here anyway, I suppose you can learn a thing or two on how and/or how not to create an engine. Suggestions are appreciated my fellow fanum taxers.

### How it worked

The idea behind ray tracing is simple: you trace ray.

But instead of tracing pretty-much-infinite-number of rays from *light* $\rightarrow$ *surface* $\rightarrow$ *camera* (like how light would irl), you trace a finite number of ray from the *camera* $\rightarrow$ *surface* $\rightarrow$ *light* and do the math in reverse. This may seem quite counter-intuitive, but the performace gain is GYATTDAMN massive since $x\rightarrow\inf$ of rays from the light doesn't even reach the camera in the first place.

Ray tracing allow for graphically complex and graphically beutiful grapich, since rays can bounces around, which allow for stuff like reflection or refraction to be possible. To handle rays bouncing around, 2 methods were proposed (by the great me ofc):

- **Recursive Ray Tracing**: the idea is the result of the next ray will influence the result of the current ray, so you trace the next ray and the next ray and the next ray... until you reach the end, or the limit of the recursion. This method is simple to implement, but un-shader-friendly, and stack overflow is a b*tch, so it's not recommended.

- **Weight Based Ray Tracing**: To implement this, we'll use a stack to store the ray. This is similar to Monte Carlo's path tracing, but deterministic instead of stochastic. Each ray has a weight, the next ray will influence the weight of the current ray, but the total weight of every ray will always be the same (sum = 1).
  - Example: 
    - Primary ray `weight = 1.0` $\rightarrow$ Hit a red surface with a `reflective = 0.5` $\rightarrow$ Primary ray `weight = 1.0 * 0.5 = 0.5` + New ray 1 `weight = 1.0 * 0.5 = 0.5`.
    - New ray 1 hit a blue surface with a `reflective = 0.5` $\rightarrow$ New ray 1 `weight = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25` + New ray 2 `weight = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25`.
    - --- 
    - $\Rightarrow$ **`Result Color`** `=` **`Blue * 0.5`** *`(from primary ray)`* `+` **`Red * 0.25`** *`(from new ray 1)`* `+` **`Blue * 0.25`** *`(from new ray 2)`* `=` **`Something idk do the math yourself`**.
    - $\Rightarrow$ **`Result Weight`** `=` `0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25` `=` **`1.0`**.

### How it is optimized

- Now that you have a basic understanding of how ray tracing works, let's talk about how to make it **faster**. There's this little thing called **BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy)**, basically: if I didn't find the box, I didn't find anything in the box.

- **BVH** allows you to **skip** a large portion of the scene that you don't need to check. This is done by dividing the scene into smaller boxes, and then dividing those boxes into even smaller boxes, and so on, until you reach what seems to be the most optimal box size.

- Here comes the tricky part, **"where do I slice the cake?"** Blindly splitting boxes can be **detrimental**, not only because an **unoptimized BVH** negates the effect of spatial partitioning, but also because the depth traversal can become a **bottleneck**, leading to worse performance than just looping through everything. This is where **Surface Area Heuristic (SAH)** comes in. **SAH** is a method to determine the optimal split point of a box by calculating the cost of splitting the box at every possible point and choosing the one with the **lowest cost**.

  - The cost formula is:  
  \[
  C_{split} = C_{trav} + \frac{A_{left}}{A_{box}}C_{left} + \frac{A_{right}}{A_{box}}C_{right}
  \]
  
  - Where:
    - **$C_{split}$** is the cost of splitting the box.
    - **$C_{trav}$** is the cost of traversing the box.
    - **$A_{box}$** is the area of the current box.
    - **$A_{left/right}$** is the area of the left/right box.
    - **$C_{left/right}$** is the cost of traversing the left/right box.

- Now that we have our bounding boxes, whatâ€™s next? Well, there are some **"minor" tweaks** that can help **boost performance** by a sizable margin:
  - **Child ordering** and **Early Exit**: Essentially, "if the left box is closer to the right box, check the left box first." If the ray hits something in the left box, there's no need to check the right box, since that hit intersection is closer than any potential intersection in the right box.

### How to Use

Just run the `AsczEngineRT_v0.exe` file, easy as that (I lied).
